My original thinking was that  it should be possible to do like this :

   
       "1***2".Split("***".ToCharArray)

I did not realise that splitting the string like that splits on each of the stars individually which means that we end up getting 2 empty values in the result :




       val it : string [] = [|"1" ; ""; ""; "2"|]


If we want to split on '***' then we have to pass it in as a value in a string array :

       "1***2".Split([| "***" |], StringSplitOptions.None);;


That way we only get the 1 and 2 which is what we want :



      val it : string [] = ["1" ; "2"]
